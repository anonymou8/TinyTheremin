<h1>A Tiny Theremin</h1>

<p>This project was inspired by <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/a_tiny_theremin">Tim&rsquo;s Tiny Theremin</a>.</p>

<p>A tiny theremin with only one component â€” Atmel <strong>ATtiny85</strong> 8-bit microcontroller.</p>

<p>To make the theremin you will need (at least):</p>

<ul>
<li>ATtiny85, ATtiny45 or similar microcontroller,</li>
<li>three pieces of a wire: 2 for each antenna and another 1 for a &ldquo;wrist strap&rdquo;,</li>
<li>some audio interface (e.g. a piezo element plus 100+ Ohm resistor),</li>
</ul>


<p>along with a 5 volts power source, facilities to flash the controller (AVR programmer)
and a breadboard or some more wires plus soldering iron.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the connection diagram:</p>

(real guitar as an accompaniment plus some reverb):</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The principle is simple. Pin stray capacitance is getting charged to 5 volts over
pin&rsquo;s pull-up resistor during non-sampling ADC period (most of the time). Then,
in sync with sampling time, while pull-up resistor stays enabled, everything
is getting discharged by a discharge pulse coming from other pin, directly connected
to human body. The human-antenna capacitance determines discharge level of the stray
capacitance.</p>

<p>The more human-antenna capacitance (closer to antenna), the deeper stray capacitance
gets discharged.</p>

<p>Pull-up resistor decreases input impedance, which helps against mains EMI.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the schematic of a pin connected to the ADC peripherals:</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the simulation of how voltage on the ADC&rsquo;s sample and hold
capacitor behaves during dischage pulses, depending on the antenna capacitance.</p>

<p>Differential input mode of ADC, along with programmable gain, makes it really
easy to measure tiny voltage changes, especially when internal 1.1V source
is selected as a reference. But actual measurements are very noisy,
considering their digital nature, so they are highly filtered (averaged)
before passing for subsequent processing.</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Code is written using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">GNU Assembler</a> for AVR.
To build it you need <code>avr-gcc</code> or <code>avr-binutils</code> to be installed. On a Unix-like system run</p>

<pre><code>./build theremin
</code></pre>

<p>You should get <code>theremin.bin</code> file, which has to be flashed onto an ATtiny85.</p>

<p>Low fuse byte must be programmed to: <code>11100001</code> (16 MHz clock from PLL).</p>

<h2>Tuning and debugging</h2>

<p>Every instrument is different and has to be tuned before playing.
For the Tiny Theremin it is not so simple.</p>

<p><img src="img/debug.png" style="width:100%; max-width:1200px;"></p>

<p>You must have some SPI on your PC to connect to an ATtiny85 and
to read ADC data it sends. For this purpose a special piece of code
is used. The program is intended only for debugging and tuning.
To build it run</p>

<pre><code>./build tune_spi
</code></pre>

<p>You should get <code>tune_spi.bin</code> file, which has to be flashed onto an ATtiny85.</p>

<p>After flashing, with each byte read from an MCU you will alternately
get an averaged ADC value from each of two antennas. A simple console
Python script for displaying the data is provided.</p>

<p>Take a look at another files in the <code>scripts</code> folder as well as the
assembler sources.</p>
